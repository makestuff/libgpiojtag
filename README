The libgpiojtag is a static-link library which parses an .svf programming file
and executes the JTAG operations specified therein on a device attached via some
simple GPIO mechanism. An example implementation is provided for the Raspberry
Pi, but porting to other Linux platforms with GPIO should be straightforward.
Internally, the library works by using an undocumented entry-point to the
FPGALink DLL, which converts an .svf text file into a much-simplified binary
format, which is easily interpreted by a simple state-machine.
